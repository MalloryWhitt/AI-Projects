# AI Image Classification and Neural Network Assignments

Two assignments completed for Auburn University's Artificial Intelligence course.  
The first explores the mathematical foundations of neural networks through manual implementation of forward and backward propagation.  
The second applies transfer learning with a pretrained convolutional model to perform image classification on the Birds 20 Species dataset.


## Assignment 1 — Neural Network Forward and Backward Pass

Implemented a simple feedforward neural network without external machine learning frameworks to understand the mechanics of supervised learning.

### Concepts
- Computation of activation functions and intermediate node values
- Derivation of delta and gradient terms for error propagation
- Relationship between activation derivatives and weight updates
- Structured simulation of forward and backward passes in Python


## Assignment 2 — Bird Image Classification with Transfer Learning

Applied a pretrained ResNet-18 architecture to classify images of bird species using PyTorch and torchvision.

### Concepts
- Dataset preprocessing and normalization with torchvision transforms
- Transfer learning using ImageNet-pretrained models for feature extraction
- Evaluation through accuracy metrics and confusion matrix analysis
- Interpretation of model generalization performance across classes


## Tools and Frameworks
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** PyTorch, torchvision, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
